    API for ECE 461/Fall 2025/Project Phase 2: A Trustworthy Model Registry"

    All endpoints have BASELINE or NON-BASELINE listed. Please read through all descriptions before raising questions.

    An `artifact_id` is a unique identifier for model/dataset/code combinations and their versions. (Key idea -> the id is unique for all entities).

    Eg.

        model_name: audience-classifier , model_version: 0.3.0 -> artifact_id: 3847247294

        dataset_name: bookcorpus, dataset_version: 2.3.0 -> artifact_id: 5738291045

        code_name: google-research-bert, code_version: 2024.01.15 -> artifact_id: 9182736455

        code_name: google-research-bert , code_version: 2023.12.01 -> artifact_id: 7364518290
