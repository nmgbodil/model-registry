"""
Net score calculation module for computing the final weighted score.

This module provides functionality to calculate the net score as a weighted sum of:
- ramp_up_time (20%)
- license (15%)
- code_quality (15%)
- dataset_and_code_score (10%)
- dataset_quality (10%)
- performance_claims (10%)
- bus_factor (10%)
- size_score (10%)

Based on Sarah's priorities for ease of ramp-up, legal compliance, and model quality.
